# Purple Notes Update Documentation

## Latest Changes (January 30, 2025)

### 1. Migration to Vite and React

The latest update to Purple Notes introduces a significant shift in our development process and project structure. We have migrated our build system to Vite and converted our application to use React components. This change brings several benefits:

- ✅ **Migrated to Vite build system**: Offers faster build times and a more efficient development experience.
- ✅ **Converted to React components**: Enhances UI modularity and maintainability.
- ✅ **Improved build performance**: Significantly reduces the time required for production builds.
- ✅ **Enhanced development experience**: Includes features like hot module replacement for real-time feedback.
- ✅ **Added hot module replacement**: Allows developers to see changes in real-time without losing state.

### 2. Project Structure

The project structure has been updated to reflect the migration to React and Vite. Here's an overview of the new structure:

```plaintext
src/
├── react/
│   ├── components/   # React components
│   ├── models/       # Data models
│   ├── services/     # Business logic
│   └── utils/        # Helper functions
├── config.js         # App configuration
└── styles/           # CSS modules
```

### 3. Run Commands

To accommodate our new setup, the commands to run the development server and build the project have changed:

#### Development Mode

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

#### Production Mode

```bash
# Build for production
npx vite build

# Preview production build
npx vite preview

# Serve production build
npx serve dist
```

### 4. Previous Updates (January 29, 2025)

#### CSS Modularization

We've reorganized our CSS into a modular structure to improve maintainability and organization:

```plaintext
styles/
├── base/
│   ├── variables.css   # Theme variables
│   ├── reset.css       # Base resets
│   └── utils.css       # Shared utilities
├── layout/
│   ├── grid.css        # Layout system
│   ├── header.css      # Header styles
│   └── footer.css      # Footer styles
├── components/
│   ├── forms.css       # Form styles
│   ├── notes.css       # Notes styles
│   ├── tasks.css       # Tasks styles
│   └── dialogs.css     # Dialog styles
└── main.css            # Style imports
```

### 5. Fixed Issues

We've addressed several core functionality and build system issues:

- ✅ React component rendering
- ✅ State management
- ✅ Component lifecycle
- ✅ Event handling
- ✅ Data persistence
- ✅ Vite configuration
- ✅ Development server
- ✅ Production builds
- ✅ Asset optimization
- ✅ Code splitting

### 6. Testing Procedures

Our testing procedures now include component testing, integration testing, and build testing to ensure reliability and performance:

1. **Component Testing**
   - Component rendering
   - State updates
   - Event handlers

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Component interactions
   - Data flow
   - Side effects

3. **Build Testing**
   - Development builds
   - Production builds
   - Asset loading

### 7. Known Limitations

With the new setup, there are a few requirements and recommendations:

1. Requires Node.js installed
2. Requires a modern browser
3. JavaScript must be enabled
4. React DevTools recommended for debugging
5. Minimum browser versions for React 18

### 8. Future Improvements

Looking ahead, we plan to introduce several improvements to further enhance our project:

1. TypeScript migration
2. Component testing setup
3. State management solution
4. Performance optimizations
5. Progressive Web App features

For more detailed architecture information, refer to [docs/architecture.md](/docs/architecture.md).

## Pre-requisites for Migration

Before starting the migration, ensure you have:

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- A basic understanding of React and Vite
- Familiarity with your existing project structure

## Step-by-Step Migration Process

1. **Set Up Vite**: Initialize a new Vite project or add Vite to your existing project.
2. **Convert to React Components**: Refactor your UI components to React.
3. **Integrate with Vite**: Adjust your project configuration to leverage Vite's capabilities.
4. **Optimize Performance**: Utilize Vite's plugins and features for performance improvements.

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **Issue**: Hot Module Replacement (HMR) not working.
  - **Solution**: Ensure your Vite configuration is correct and that you're using the latest version of Vite and React.

- **Issue**: Build performance issues.
  - **Solution**: Analyze the build with Vite's visualizer plugin and remove or optimize heavy dependencies.
