### Recent Updates on Vite Configuration

The recent update to our Vite configuration introduces significant enhancements to our development environment, aimed at improving both the developer experience and the application's performance. Key changes include:

- **Allowed Hosts Configuration**: We've configured the server to allow any ngrok subdomain, facilitating easier testing and sharing of development builds.
- **CORS Enabled**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is now enabled by default, simplifying development across different environments.
- **Custom Port and Host Settings**: The development server now runs on port 3500 and is set to `localhost` by default. This change ensures a consistent and conflict-free development environment.
- **Strict Port Usage**: The `strictPort` setting ensures that Vite will only run on the specified port, preventing issues related to port conflicts.

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    allowedHosts: [
      '.ngrok-free.app',
      '.ngrok.io'
    ],
    cors: true,
    port: 3500,
    host: 'localhost',
    strictPort: true
  }
})
```

These updates are part of our ongoing efforts to streamline the development process, making it faster and more reliable for our team.
