# Purple Notes Update Documentation

## Latest Changes (January 30, 2025)

### 1. Migration to Vite and React
- ✅ Migrated to Vite build system
- ✅ Converted to React components
- ✅ Improved build performance
- ✅ Enhanced development experience
- ✅ Added hot module replacement

### 2. Project Structure

```
src/
├── react/
│   ├── components/   # React components
│   ├── models/       # Data models
│   ├── services/     # Business logic
│   └── utils/        # Helper functions
├── config.js         # App configuration
└── styles/           # CSS modules
```

### 3. Vite Configuration Update

The introduction of a new `vite.config.js` file marks a significant enhancement in our development environment setup. This configuration optimizes our development experience by integrating the React plugin, setting up a development server with specific allowed hosts and CORS enabled, and customizing the server port. Here's a brief overview of the key configurations:

- **React Plugin Integration**: Simplifies the use of React by automatically applying necessary Babel transformations and optimizations.
- **Development Server Customization**: Allows ngrok subdomains, enabling developers to easily share their work with others. CORS is enabled to support cross-origin requests, essential for API interactions during development.
- **Port and Host Configuration**: The server is set to run on port 3500 and listens on `localhost`, ensuring a consistent and isolated development environment.

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    allowedHosts: [
      '.ngrok-free.app',
      '.ngrok.io'
    ],
    cors: true,
    port: 3500,
    host: 'localhost',
    strictPort: true
  }
})
```

This configuration enhances our development workflow by providing a more robust and flexible setup, catering to our specific project needs.
