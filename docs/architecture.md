# Purple Notes Architecture

## Overview

Purple Notes has evolved into a modern React application, leveraging Vite for an enhanced development experience and optimized production builds. This document outlines the updated architecture, focusing on the integration of Vite and React, the restructured file system, and the refined CSS architecture.

## Updated Project Structure

The project's structure has been updated to accommodate the migration to Vite and React, ensuring a more organized and scalable codebase. Key changes include the restructuring of React components, the introduction of modules for state management, and the optimization of the build system.

├── src/
│   ├── components/       # React UI components
│   │   ├── notes/        # Notes related components
│   │   │   ├── NoteForm.jsx   # Note creation component
│   │   │   ├── NoteCard.jsx   # Individual note display
│   │   │   └── NoteList.jsx   # Notes collection manager
│   │   └── tasks/        # Tasks related components
│   │       ├── TaskForm.jsx   # Task creation component

├── public/               # Static assets like images and icons
├── vite.config.js        # Vite configuration
├── index.html            # Main HTML entry point
└── package.json          # Project configuration and scripts
```

## Vite and React Integration

The integration of Vite with React in Purple Notes offers a seamless development experience with features like Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and efficient production builds. Vite's configuration has been tailored to support JSX, CSS Modules, and React Fast Refresh, enhancing the development workflow.

```typescript
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  // Additional configuration options...
});
```

This setup ensures that Purple Notes benefits from Vite's speed and React's component-based architecture, making the development process more efficient and enjoyable.

## CSS Architecture with Vite

The CSS architecture in Purple Notes has been reorganized to leverage Vite's capabilities, including CSS Modules and PostCSS plugins. This approach allows for scoped styles, reducing the risk of style conflicts and enhancing maintainability.

```plaintext
styles/
├── base/
│   ├── variables.module.css   # Theme variables and custom properties
│   ├── reset.module.css       # Base resets and normalizations
│   └── utils.module.css       # Shared utilities and animations
├── components/
│   ├── NoteCard.module.css    # Styles for the NoteCard component
│   ├── TaskItem.module.css    # Styles for the TaskItem component
│   └── ...                    # Other component styles
```

Each React component imports its corresponding CSS Module, ensuring styles are encapsulated and applied only to the component they belong to.

```typescript
// Example of importing a CSS Module in a React component
import styles from './NoteCard.module.css';

const NoteCard = () => {
  return <div className={styles.noteCard}>...</div>;
};
```

## Development Workflow

The development workflow has been optimized with scripts for starting the development server, building for production, and previewing the production build locally.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```

Running `npm run dev` launches the development server with HMR, `npm run build` creates an optimized production build, and `npm run preview` serves the production build locally for testing.

## Key Features

The core features of Purple Notes, including the notes system, tasks system, theme system, and notifications, remain integral to the application, now enhanced by the improved architecture and development tools.

## Technical Decisions

The migration to Vite and React represents a strategic decision to leverage modern tooling and frameworks for better performance, developer experience, and future scalability. This update positions Purple Notes for continued growth and feature development.

## Conclusion

The updated architecture of Purple Notes, with its focus on Vite and React integration, presents a robust foundation for the application. This migration not only improves the development workflow but also enhances the overall performance and maintainability of the project, ensuring its long-term success.
