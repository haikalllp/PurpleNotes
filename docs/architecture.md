# Purple Notes Architecture

## Overview

Purple Notes is a modern React application designed for efficient note and task management. With the recent integration of Vite, the project boasts a faster development server and optimized production builds, enhancing both developer experience and application performance.

## Updated Project Structure

The transition to Vite as our build tool necessitated a few changes in our project's structure and build configuration. These changes streamline development workflows and improve build performance.

### Build System Overview with Vite

- **Vite**: Serves as the core build tool, offering rapid development server start-up and efficient bundling for production.
- **ES Modules**: Leverages native ES Modules for better tree-shaking and module optimization.
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Ensures instantaneous feedback during development by enabling state-preserving component-level hot reloading.

### Core Files

- **vite.config.js**: Contains Vite-specific configuration, replacing previous build system configurations.
- **app.js**: Remains the main entry point for the React application, initializing the component tree.
- **index.html**: The root HTML file now includes Vite-specific script tags for module loading.

```typescript
// vite.config.js example
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()]
});
```

### React Components

The structure within the `src/` directory remains largely unchanged, focusing on a clear separation of concerns between UI components, models, services, and utilities.

```typescript
src/
├── react/
│   └── components/     // React UI components
│       ├── notes/      // Notes related components
│       │   ├── NoteForm.js   // Note creation component
│       │   ├── NoteCard.js   // Individual note display
│       │   └── NoteList.js   // Notes collection manager
│       └── tasks/      // Tasks related components
│           ├── TaskForm.js   // Task creation component
│           ├── TaskItem.js   // Individual task display
│           └── TaskList.js   // Tasks collection manager
|       ├── models/            // Data models
|       ├── services/          // Core services
|       └── utils/             // Utility functions
├── config.js          // Application-wide configuration and settings management
```

### Styles Organization

The organization of styles within the `styles/` directory is optimized for modularity and ease of maintenance, supporting CSS modules and pre-processor files.

```typescript
styles/
├── base/
│   ├── variables.scss   // Theme variables and custom properties
│   ├── reset.scss       // Base resets and normalizations
│   └── utils.scss       // Shared utilities and animations
├── layout/
│   ├── grid.scss       // Layout grid system
│   ├── header.scss     // Header component styles
│   └── footer.scss     // Footer component styles
└── components/
    ├── forms.scss      // Form elements and controls
    ├── notes.scss      // Note cards and interactions
    ├── tasks.scss      // Task list and interactions
    └── dialogs.scss    // Notifications and modals
```

## Development Workflow

### Scripts

Updated scripts in `package.json` to utilize Vite's commands for development, building, and previewing the application.

- `npm run dev`: Starts the Vite development server with HMR.
- `npm run build`: Creates an optimized production build using Vite.
- `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally for testing.

### Build Configuration

The build configuration now relies on Vite, with plugins for React support, CSS modules, and asset optimization. This setup provides a more efficient build process and faster development cycle.

## Key Features

The core features of Purple Notes, including the notes system, tasks system, theme system, and notifications, remain integral to the application's functionality, benefiting from the improved build and development system.

## Technical Decisions

### React Architecture

The adoption of Vite has not altered our commitment to functional components, React Hooks, component composition, and props-based communication. These principles continue to guide our React architecture.

### CSS Architecture

With Vite, we maintain our modular CSS organization, component-based styling, and emphasis on shared utilities, animations, and custom properties for theming. The move to Vite enhances our ability to leverage CSS modules and preprocessors for scalable and maintainable styles.

### Build System

Vite significantly enhances our build system with faster development, optimized production builds, asset optimization, and code splitting, aligning with our goals for performance and efficiency.

### State Management

Our approach to state management remains focused on React state hooks, local storage for persistence, and clean state initialization, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly application.

## File Structure

The file structure has been updated to reflect the integration of Vite, with a focus on maintaining a clear and logical organization of source code, styles, assets, and configuration files.

```typescript
purple-notes/
├── src/               // Source code
│   ├── react/         // React components
│       ├── components/   // UI components
│       ├── models/        // Data models
│       ├── services/      // Core services
│       └── utils/         // Utility functions
│   ├── config.js        // Application-wide configuration and settings
├── styles/            // Modular CSS and SCSS files
│   ├── base/          // Base styles
│   ├── layout/        // Layout components
│   ├── components/    // Component styles
│   └── main.scss      // SCSS entry point
├── vite.config.js     // Vite configuration
├── index.html         // Main HTML
└── package.json       // Project configuration
```

## Component Communication

The principles of component communication through props, context, custom hooks, and service-based state management continue to be key aspects of our architecture, ensuring modular and maintainable code.

## Data Flow

The data flow within Purple Notes, from user interactions to state changes and component updates, benefits from the efficient development and build processes provided by Vite, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Style Organization

Our CSS architecture, focusing on base styles, layout components, UI components, and responsive design, is optimized for performance and maintainability, supported by Vite's build capabilities.

## Performance

Vite's build optimizations, including tree shaking, code splitting, and asset optimization, contribute to the high performance of Purple Notes, alongside React and CSS optimizations for a seamless user experience.

## Browser Support

Purple Notes continues to support modern browsers, leveraging ES6+ features, local storage, CSS Grid and Flexbox, and CSS Custom Properties, ensuring a wide user base.

## Future Considerations

Future enhancements, such as PWA implementation, cloud sync, and advanced state management solutions, will benefit from the flexible and efficient architecture provided by Vite, supporting the ongoing development of Purple Notes.
