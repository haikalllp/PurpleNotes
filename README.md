## What is Vite?

Vite is a modern build tool that provides a fast development environment for web applications. It leverages native ES modules in the browser, allowing for instant server start and hot module replacement (HMR) during development. Vite is particularly well-suited for projects using frameworks like React, as it optimizes the build process and improves performance.

## Why Vite for React Projects?

Using Vite in React projects offers several advantages:

- **Fast Development**: Vite's server starts quickly, and updates are reflected instantly in the browser.
- **Optimized Builds**: Vite automatically optimizes your code for production, ensuring better performance.
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Vite supports a wide range of plugins, including those specifically designed for React, enhancing functionality and ease of use.

## Quick Start with Vite Configuration

The following configuration has been added to the project to set up Vite for a React application:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    allowedHosts: [ // added to allow any ngrok subdomain
      '.ngrok-free.app',
      '.ngrok.io'
    ],
    cors: true, // Enable CORS
    port: 3500,
    host: 'localhost', // set to true to use network and open the local IP address
    strictPort: true
  }
})
```

### Configuration Breakdown

- **Plugins**: The `react` plugin is included to support React features.
- **Server Configuration**:
  - `allowedHosts`: Specifies allowed hosts for the development server, including ngrok subdomains.
  - `cors`: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
  - `port`: Sets the development server to run on port 3500.
  - `host`: Configures the server to run on localhost. Set to `true` to use the network IP.
  - `strictPort`: Ensures the server fails to start if the specified port is already in use.

This configuration ensures a smooth development experience and allows for easy sharing of the application via services like ngrok.
